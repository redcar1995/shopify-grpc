This directory contains MS Visual Studio project & solution files.

#Supported Visual Studio versions

Currently supported versions are Visual Studio 2013 (our primary focus) and 2010.

#Building
We are using [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org) to pull zlib and openssl dependencies.
If you don't have Visual Studio NuGet plugin installed, you'll need to
download nuget.exe from web and manually restore the NuGet packages.

```
> REM Run from this directory.
> REM No need to do this if you have NuGet visual studio extension.
> nuget restore
```

After that, open `grpc.sln` with Visual Studio and hit "Build".

#Testing

Use `run_tests.py`, that also supports Windows (with a bit limited experience).
```
REM Run from repository root.
python tools\run_tests\run_tests.py -l c
```

Also, you can `make.bat` directly to build and run gRPC tests.
```
REM Run from this directory.
make.bat alarm_test
```
