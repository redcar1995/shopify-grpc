# Scripts for building gRPC C# package for Unity

Scripts in this directory are of no interest for end users. They are part
of internal tooling to automate building of the gRPC C# package for Unity.

- `unitypackage_skeleton` - preconfigured .meta files for the unity package
  layout. The actual assemblies and native libraries will be added into
  this hierarchy while building the package.
