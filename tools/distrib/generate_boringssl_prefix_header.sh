# Generate the list of boringssl symbols that need to be renamed based on the
# current boringssl submodule. The script should be run after a boringssl
# upgrade in third_party/boringssl-with-bazel. Note that after the script is
# run, you will typically need to manually upgrade the BoringSSL-GRPC podspec
# (templates/src/objective-c/BoringSSL-GRPC.podspec.template) version and the
# corresponding version number in gRPC-Core podspec
# (templates/gRPC-Core.podspec.template).
